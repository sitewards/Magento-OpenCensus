# Magento OpenCensus

## Project Outline

This is the Magento 2 opencensus project. It integrates these two projects together:

- Magento 2: An open source e-commerce platform
- OpenCensus: An implementation of Transaction Tracing

## Similar Work

- The author knows of some work to integrate the profiler with flame graphs.

## Justification

Transaction Traces allow getting complex performance data from an application in an easy to navigate format.

## Usage:

Probably don't. It's still very experimental.
